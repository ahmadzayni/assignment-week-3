    <p>Container ships (sometimes spelled containerships) are cargo ships that carry all of their load in truck-size intermodal containers, in a technique called containerization. They are a common means of commercial intermodal freight transport and now carry most seagoing non-bulk cargo. </p>
<br>Container ship capacity is measured in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). Typical loads are a mix of 20-foot and 40-foot (2-TEU) ISO-standard containers, with the latter predominant.<br>

Today, about 90% of non-bulk cargo worldwide is transported by container ships, and the largest modern container ships can carry over 21,000 TEU (e.g., OOCL Hong Kong). Container ships now rival crude oil tankers and bulk carriers as the largest commercial seaborne vessels</p>

    <p>Ships used to move packaged merchandise from one location to another. Due to the vast range of cargo materials, these ships are often designed specifically for the cargo which they will carry. General information 
General cargo vessels vary in length between 80 and 160 m, the latter having a deadweight of about 20.000 tons. The cargo holds of these multi purpose vessels are able to handle both containers and all sorts of cargo.

    <p>The seaborne transport of liquefied gases began in 1934 when a major international company put two combined oil/LPG tankers into operation. The ships, basically oil tankers, had been converted by fitting small, riveted, pressure vessels for the carriage of LPG into cargo tank spaces. This enabled transport over long distances of substantial volumes of an oil refinery by-product that had distinct advantages as a domestic and commercial fuel. LPG is not only odourless and non-toxic, it also has a high calorific value and a low sulphur content, making it very clean and efficient when being burnt.</p>
